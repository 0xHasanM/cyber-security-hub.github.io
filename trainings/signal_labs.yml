   - title: Offensive Tool Development
     short-description: Windows-focused course on modern custom C2, implant & post-exploitation techniques developed from scratch leveraging Rust.
     description: |
      This course covers custom tool development for offensive security campaigns at the user, kernel and hypervisor levels. 
      Write your own custom code in Rust from scratch, covering both the high-level design of our code to complete guided walkthroughs of our custom code development process, including our own Rust-based COFF loaders, anti-EDR modules, C2 server and agents, kernel rootkits, hypervisor implants and more.

   - title: Reverse Engineering
     short-description: Real-world reverse engineering applied to closed-source user and kernel targets, covering beginner and advanced topics including custom deobfuscation routine development in Rust.
     description: |
      In addition to the more expected Reverse Engineering content you also learn the underlying environment binaries operate on (x86-64, Boot process (UEFI|BIOS), PE32/32+ formats, Page Table concepts & Kernel/Hypervisor) alongside actual exercises in writing your own Kernel drivers and working with Rust.
