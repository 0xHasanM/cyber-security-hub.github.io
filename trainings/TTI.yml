   - title: Responsible Red Teaming
     short-description: A course on the ethics, legality, and tactical considerations for red teaming activity.
     description: | 
      Many courses on red teaming will teach you the technical process of how to exploit targets. But seldom do courses cover what it means to carry out the role of a red teamer responsibly.
      Responsible Red Teaming is a seminar on the ethical, legal, and tactical considerations of how to perform red team operations that are safe, responsible, and practical. 
      It includes written lectures and practical labs centered on how we can emulate cybercriminals without introducing the risk of real cyber crime. This course asks you to think deeply 
      about what it means to you to be a considerate, ethical, responsible red teamer. It will then show you how to translate responsibility into practical application and refine your 
      tradecraft in the areas of C2 infrastructure design, malware emulation, and payload engineering. This is not a course that teaches you how to be a red teamer. 
      It’s a course where you learn how to operate with honor.

   - title: Practical Threat Hunting
     short-description: A course on navigating the concepts around binary exploitation
     description: |
      If you have a basic conceptual understanding of binary exploitation (specifically, stack-based buffer overflows) but aren't quite 100% sure what concepts like 
      'ASLR', 'RELRO', 'PIE' or 'ROP' mean, this is the course for you. The goal of this guide is to give an overview of modern binary exploitation mitigations, 
      why they were introduced and how they have been defeated. All in a practical and hands-on way.
